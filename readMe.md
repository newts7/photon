This is a view of my journey in the programming  world since
2014- current. 

##### My tech know how ?

- **Languages** - C/C++, Python, Golang, JS, TypeScript.....

```angular2html
Learning Languages is an infant game,
You should know how to talk

```

- **Web** - MEAN, Hapi, ReactJS, MongoDB, MySQL, Django, ElasticSearch

```angular2html
 Frameworks are the results of one's Desires
```
p:s : I love Designing Data Architecture of Products. 

- **Competitve Programming** - _newts_ is the handle on all programming platforms,
I have solved over 2000 problems on various online Judges.

##### Whats in for you?

- I am summing all my experiences from being a novice. I think i can help someone who has a programming phobia
or thinks there are demons inside. No, _That's where my Demons hide_

ex: 
My first program in C was 
```angular2html
#include<studio.h>
scanf(a,b)
printf(Your sum is a+b)
```
